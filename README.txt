The goal is to get all the bars in the top left full. By shining a light with the corresponding color onto one of the absorbers (spheres) it will increase the value but if it’s the wrong light color it will decrease it. So, you would have to find a position for all the lights where they wouldn’t be shining on the wrong absorber (sphere).

If you really can't figure it out then i reccomend checking the gif in week 8 of the learning log showing me completing the level.

Controls!

Move your mouse close to a light and hold space. You can now move your mouse and the light will move with it. It will not be able to move through walls.

debug controls:
R = shoot test ray with debug drawing
T = clear debug lines
Y = set active material
U = send a trace and get the result
I = toggle debug hud
